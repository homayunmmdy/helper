      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        WhatsApp is one of the most popular and practical messaging apps today,
        with a growing user base due to its versatile features, such as voice
        and video calls. However, WhatsApp is not an ID-based application,
        meaning that someone must have your phone number to contact you.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        Unlike Telegram and other platforms, WhatsApp does not support user IDs.
        However, with tools like this WhatsApp Link Generator, you can create a
        custom link to share your WhatsApp contact without requiring others to
        save your number. For example, you can include this link in your resume,
        website, or social media profiles, allowing others to start a chat with
        you directly.
